## What it is about:
* This project tests my ability to use version control, GitHub, Git, and GitFlow as well as Gradle. I am to properly use and write this project to the fullest and hopefully meeting the requirements of it actually being a proper project.
* The second part of this project is a simple mathematical expression evaluator. It will have three version releases:
1. Release 1.0.0 - In this version it is simply getting started, initializing, and changing the project.
2. Release 1.1.0 - In this version, it has the added evaluation component that will take an expression and return the result.
3. Release 1.2.0 - In this version, it will have the ablility to output multiple locations.
***
## Installation
* The best way to install this program that I know of is by cloning the project.
* Then run gradle assemble, copy the file to specified location, and then unzip it.
***
## Usage
* This project will help with simple mathmatical evaluations.
***
## Contributing
* There are many ways to contribute such as adding more methods to help the program accept more advanced mathmatical equations.
